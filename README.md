# Minimalism
Minimalist Artwork in Processing

This is a project to recreate minimalist artworks in Processing.

Example:

<img src="https://github.com/loserwave/WebMinimalism/blob/master/Example.jpg">

This is **Piet Mondrian's** *Composition with Yellow Blue and Red* Recreated within WebMinimalism

These projects work with Processing 2 and 3 (Processing 1 compatibility is untested), the Python files work with <a href="https://github.com/jdf/processing.py">Processing.py.</a>

For now this project just consists of static files as an study of the **De Stijl**, **Abstract**, and **Minimalist** art styles and how they translate to code.
